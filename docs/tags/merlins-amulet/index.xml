      <description>I made a pattern in illustrator, you can download the pattern for free here: Trollhunters amulet blueprint.
Made the basic shape out of Sintra and for the details I mostly used two part epoxy putty to be able to sculpt detail runes all the way round. For the amulets base I created a two part mold, and the castings where roto-casted however this didn&amp;rsquo;t work very well, since it was very dificult to keep a consistent thikness thougout all the piece, I actually ended up filling up the rim sides with epoxy putty after I casted the piece so that I could have a more solid piece to work on.</description>

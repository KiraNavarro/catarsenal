Hello! I'm Jess and I am a Prop And Modelkit Maker, I create Scratch build models, props and custom collectibles. 

Recently I  got more interested in dioramas and props for action figures so that they have a better display and also Iâ€™m trying out toy photography with the stuff I build. 

You can contact me or find out what I'm working on here:

      <description>This was sculpted in an oil based clay and then molded and casted in resin.
To paint this sculpt I sprayed a base coat of silver paint and then masked and airbrushed the red sections.
I really struggled in painting this one, I used Tamiya red transparent which has a weird consistency, it is a bit more thicker and sticky than the other paints, so what I learned from this is to add just a bit of water to the paint, only about 2 or 3 drops, and also spray small amounts of paint at a time because this paint dries even faster and it clogs the airbrush pretty fast.</description>
